# Breast Cancer Analysis  

## Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing breast cancer data to derive meaningful insights and build predictive models. The goal is to classify tumors as benign or malignant using machine learning techniques and statistical analysis.  

## Dataset  
The dataset used in this project contains features extracted from breast cancer cell nuclei, such as radius, texture, perimeter, and smoothness. It is sourced from a reliable medical repository and is commonly used for classification tasks.  

## Objectives  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand feature distributions and correlations.  
- Preprocess data by handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables.  
- Implement machine learning models to classify breast cancer cases.  
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  

## Methodology  
1. **Data Exploration:** Visualizing distributions, correlations, and key statistics.  
2. **Preprocessing:** Handling missing data, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.  
3. **Feature Selection:** Identifying the most important features for classification.  
4. **Model Training:** Implementing classification models like Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and others.  
5. **Model Evaluation:** Comparing models using cross-validation and performance metrics.  

## Outputs  

### 1. Data Visualization  
- **Feature Correlation Heatmap:** Displayed the relationships between variables to identify highly correlated features.  
- **Histograms & Boxplots:** Showed the distribution of key features for both benign and malignant cases.  

### 2. Model Performance  
| Model                  | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|------------------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Logistic Regression    | 96.5%    | 95.8%     | 97.2%  | 96.5%    |
| Random Forest         | 97.8%    | 98.0%     | 97.5%  | 97.7%    |
| Support Vector Machine | 98.2%    | 98.5%     | 97.8%  | 98.1%    |  

- **Confusion Matrix:** Showed true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative classifications.  
- **ROC Curve & AUC Score:** Demonstrated the model's ability to distinguish between benign and malignant cases.  

### 3. Key Insights
